# Three-Tier DevOps AWS Project




A comprehensive DevOps implementation showcasing modern cloud infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices for a three-tier web application on AWS.

## 🎯 Project Overview
![Project Overview](static/images/project.png)


This project demonstrates enterprise-grade DevOps practices by implementing a complete cloud infrastructure and deployment pipeline for a three-tier web application. While the application code (React frontend and Spring Boot backend) is sourced from the open-source community, **all DevOps engineering, infrastructure design, and automation is original work**.

### What I Built

- **Complete AWS Infrastructure** - Terraform modules for scalable, secure cloud architecture
- **CI/CD Pipelines** - Automated testing, building, and deployment workflows
- **Infrastructure as Code** - Modular, reusable Terraform configurations
- **Security & Compliance** - Best practices for cloud security and monitoring
- **Multi-Environment Support** - Dev/staging/production environment management

## 🏗️ Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](infra/static/images/architecture.png)

### Infrastructure Components

- **Frontend Tier**: React SPA served via CloudFront CDN + S3
- **Backend Tier**: Spring Boot API on ECS Fargate with Application Load Balancer
- **Data Tier**: MySQL RDS with automated backups and scaling
- **Networking**: VPC with public/private subnets across multiple AZs
- **Security**: SSL/TLS encryption, security groups, and IAM roles
- **DNS**: Route 53 hosted zone with custom domain management

Read more about the architecture and design choices in the [Infrastructure as Code](infra/README.md) section.

#### Continuous Deployment

**Frontend CD**: Automated deployment pipeline that uploads build artifacts to S3 (requires manual approval) on successful push to the main branch from `/src/frontend`. The React application is built, optimized, and deployed to S3, then distributed globally via CloudFront CDN. Requires manual approval for production deployment.

**Backend CD**: Automated deployment pipeline that deploys containerized Spring Boot application to ECS Fargate (requires manual approval) on every successful push to the main branch from `/src/backend`. Uses rolling updates for zero-downtime deployments with health checks and automatic rollback capabilities.


### Key DevOps Practices

✅ **Infrastructure as Code** - 100% Terraform-managed infrastructure  
✅ **GitOps Workflow** - Git-based infrastructure and deployment management  
✅ **Multi-Environment** - Separate dev/staging/production environments  
✅ **Security First** - SSL/TLS, security groups, least privilege access  
✅ **Monitoring & Logging** - CloudWatch integration and alerting  
✅ **Cost Optimization** - Spot instances, autoscaling, resource tagging  
✅ **Disaster Recovery** - Multi-AZ deployment, automated backups
